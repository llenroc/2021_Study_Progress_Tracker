## 1. Coding Interview

### a. Data Structures

#### a.1 Array
| Topic  | Problems Attempted | Solutions | Companies | Completed Status  |
| ------ | -----------------  | --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Array | [LC-904 - Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/) |           | Google          | :white_check_mark: |
| Array | [LC-1 - Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) |           | Google          | :white_check_mark: |
| Array | [LC-683 - K Empty Slots K empty slot](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-empty-slots/) |           | Google          | :white_check_mark: |

#### a.2 String
| Topic  | Problems Attempted | Solutions | Companies | Completed Status  |
| ------ | -----------------  | --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| String | [LC-929 - Unique Email Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-email-addresses/) |           | Google    | :white_check_mark: |
| String | **LC-681 - Next Closest Time**  | | Google    | :white_check_mark: |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | Given a time represented in the format “HH:MM”, form the next closest time by reusing the current digits.  | | | |
|        | There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.  | | | |
|        | You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, “01:34”, “12:09” are all valid. “1:34”, “12:9” are all invalid.  | | | |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | **Example 1:** | | | |
|        | **Input:** "19:34" | | | |
|        | **Output:** "19:39" | | | |
|        | **Explanation:** The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.  It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.  | | | |
|        | **Example 2:**  | | | |
|        | **Input:** "23:59"  | | | |
|        | **Output:** "22:22"  | | | |
|        | **Explanation:** The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22. It may be assumed that the returned time is next day's time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.  | | | |
| String | [LC-681 - License Key Formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/) |           | Google    | :white_check_mark: |
