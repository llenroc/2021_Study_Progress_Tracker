## 1. Coding Interview

### a. Data Structures

#### a.1 Array
| Topic  | Problems Attempted | Solutions | Companies | Completed Status  |
| ------ | -----------------  | --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Array | [LC-904 - Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/) |           | Google          | :white_check_mark: |
| Array | [LC-1 - Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) |           | Google          | :white_check_mark: |
| Array | **LC-683 - K Empty Slots K empty slot** |           | Google          | :white_check_mark: |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | Given a time represented in the format “HH:MM”, form the next closest time by reusing the current digits.  | | | |
|        | There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.  | | | |
|        | You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, “01:34”, “12:09” are all valid. “1:34”, “12:9” are all invalid.  | | | |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower.  | | | |
|        | The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days. In each day,  | | | |
|        | there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.  | | | |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N.  | | | |
|        | Each number in the array represents the place where the flower will open in that day.  | | | |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i  | | | |
|        | will be at position x, where i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.  | | | |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers  | | | |
|        | in the status of blooming, and also the number of flowers between them is k and  | | | |
|        | these flowers are not blooming.  | | | |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | If there isn't such day, output -1.  | | | |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | Example 1:  | | | |
|        | Input:  | | | |
|        | flowers: [1,3,2]  | | | |
|        | k: 1  | | | |
|        | Output: 2  | | | |
|        | Explanation: In the second day, the first and the third flower have become blooming.
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | Example 2:  | | | |
|        | Input:  | | | |
|        | flowers: [1,2,3]  | | | |
|        | k: 1  | | | |
|        | Output: -1  | | | |
|        | Note:  | | | |
|        | The given array will be in the range [1, 20000].  | | | |

#### a.2 String
| Topic  | Problems Attempted | Solutions | Companies | Completed Status  |
| ------ | -----------------  | --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| String | [LC-929 - Unique Email Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-email-addresses/) |           | Google    | :white_check_mark: |
| String | **LC-681 - Next Closest Time**  | | Google    | :white_check_mark: |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | Given a time represented in the format “HH:MM”, form the next closest time by reusing the current digits.  | | | |
|        | There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.  | | | |
|        | You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, “01:34”, “12:09” are all valid. “1:34”, “12:9” are all invalid.  | | | |
|        | ---------- | | | |
|        | **Example 1:** | | | |
|        | **Input:** "19:34" | | | |
|        | **Output:** "19:39" | | | |
|        | **Explanation:** The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.  It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.  | | | |
|        | **Example 2:**  | | | |
|        | **Input:** "23:59"  | | | |
|        | **Output:** "22:22"  | | | |
|        | **Explanation:** The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22. It may be assumed that the returned time is next day's time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.  | | | |
